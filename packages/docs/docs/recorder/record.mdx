The Recorder ships with its own recording interface.  
From it, you can record a video and add it as a scene to your project.

## Setup

To start the recording interface, run:

```tsx
bun run dev
```

A Vite app will start. Open the URL in the browser.  
Give the page access to the webcam and microphone.

Alternatively, you can also use the hosted version at [record.remotion.dev](https://record.remotion.dev).

## Select sources

In the top left panel, select the right webcam and microphone.  
In the top right panel, select the screen you want to record.

The two panels at the bottom should be left empty.  
They are not being used by default, unless you develop your own workflow that requires more sources being recorded at once.

## Before starting

Take a deep breath and think of what you are about to say and show.

Prefer making short recordings, because if you mess up a take, you need to discard it entirely.

There is no countdown, the recording will start immediately, but the silence at the beginning will be automatically removed later.

## Start the recording

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    alignItems: "center",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
  }}
>
  <div>
    To start recording, press <kbd>R</kbd> or click{" "}
  </div>
  <RecordingButton type="start" />
  <div>in the top left corner.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    alignItems: "center",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
  }}
>
  <div>Once you are done with the scene, click</div>
  <RecordingButton type="stop" />
  <div>.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <div>
    The recordings will automatically be downloaded to your Downloads
    folder.{" "}
  </div>
</div>

## Selecting a take

After you have recorded a scene and you are happy with your take, run

```bash
bun copy.ts
```

to copy the file from your `Downloads` folder into your project.

The script will do the following:

- Remove the silence from the start and end of the videos.
- Convert the videos from WebM to MP4
- Put them into your project under `public/[id]`.

## Discard a take

If you have taken a recording, you don't want to use, you don't need to do anything.  
Just give it another try.

You may delete the files from your Downloads folder to save space.
