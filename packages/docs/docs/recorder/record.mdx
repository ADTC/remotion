The Recorder ships with its own recording interface.  
From it, you can record a clip and add it as a [scene](/docs/recorder/editing/scenes#video-scene) to your video.

## Setup

To start the recording interface and the Remotion Studio, run:

```bash
bun start
```

For the recording interface, a Vite app will start. Open the URL in the browser.  
Give the page access to the webcam and microphone.

Alternatively, you can also use the hosted version at [record.remotion.dev](https://record.remotion.dev).

## Select sources

In the top left panel, select the right webcam and microphone.  
In the top right panel, select the screen you want to record.

If you want to record more media sources in parallel, click 'show more' below the two panels to display two additional panels from which you can select further media
sources to record.

## Before starting

Take a deep breath and think of what you are about to say and show.

Prefer making short recordings, because you can only use a take as a whole, which means that after recording you
can either use the whole clip or discard it.

There is no countdown, the recording will start immediately, but the silence at the beginning will be automatically removed later.

## Start the recording

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    alignItems: "center",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
  }}
>
  <div>
    To start recording, press <kbd>R</kbd> or click{" "}
  </div>
  <RecordingButton type="start" />
  <div>in the top left corner.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    alignItems: "center",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
  }}
>
  <div>Once you are done with the scene, click</div>
  <RecordingButton type="stop" />
  <div>.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <div>You will be asked if you want to use this take or discard it.</div>
</div>

## Selecting a take

If you are selecting the take, the clip will be processed and stored to `public/[id]` in your project folder.

When processing the clip, the silence parts at the start and end of the recording get removed and the file gets converted from WebM to MP4.

## Discard a take

If you are not happy with the clip you recorded and therefore don't want to use it, click on `discard`.  
This simply deletes the file from memory.
