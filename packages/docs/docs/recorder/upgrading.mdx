Since the Recorder ships as source code and allows you to hack around with it, your version will diverge from our template, at least once we release an update.

You may run

```
bun update.ts
```

to copy all files from our template into your version of the Recorder, except the `public`, `config` and `remotion/Root.tsx` folders.
This upgrades your local Remotion Recorder to the latest version.
