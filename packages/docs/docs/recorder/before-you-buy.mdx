The Remotion Recorder is a first-of-its-kind JavaScript-based video creation tool where you are in control of the source code.

## What skills do I need?

You must be able to:

- Clone a Git repository
- Execute commands in the command line
- Setup a TypeScript project.

To create videos with our default style.

## Do I need to know how to code?

For creating a video in the default style, you do not need to code.  
However, we think that the Recorder is mostly appealing to developers, because of the sheer customization that is possible by modifying the code.

## Who is this for?

The Recorder is for people who appreciate videos being generated with code, and for people who want to fully own their workflow.

It works best for creators who film their face and their screen to create technical content.

The Recorder does not have a comparable feature set to traditional video editors.
