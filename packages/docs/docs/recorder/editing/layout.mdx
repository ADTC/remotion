# Layout

There is a `landscape` and a `square` layout you can choose from to define the aspect ratio of your video. The video content is automatically adapted to the selected layout, so a video can be rendered in both landscape and portrait mode without you having to adjust anything manually.

<br />
<br />
<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "space-around",
    gap: 10,
    alignItems: "center",
    maxWidth: "72rem",
  }}
>
  {/* <Layout type={"portrait"} aspectWidth={9} aspectHeight={16} /> */}
  <Layout type={"landscape"} aspectWidth={16} aspectHeight={9} />
  <Layout type={"square"} aspectWidth={1} aspectHeight={1} />
</div>
<br />
<br />
To change the layout, change the <code>canvasLayout</code> property in the right
sidebar.
