# Chapters

To add chapters, add a non-empty string in the `newChapter` input field.
Based on the chapters, timestamps are generated that can be used e.g., in the YouTube description to enable YouTubes' chaptering.

{/* ADD HOW INFORMATION ON CHAPTERS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING TIMESTAMPS CAN BE ACCESSED */}

For a camera scene in `landscape` format consisting of a webcam recording and a screen recording, the chapter name will always be displayed.
In order to stop displaying the chapter name after a camera scene, check the `stopChapteringAfterThis` checkbox.
