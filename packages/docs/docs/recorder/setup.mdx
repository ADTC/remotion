# Setup

First, [purchase](/docs/recorder/buy) the Recorder to [get access to the repo](https://github.com/remotion-dev/recorder).

## 1. Fork and clone

[Create a fork](https://github.com/remotion-dev/recorder/fork) of the `remotion-dev/recorder` repository.

:::note
You need to keep your fork **private** to not leak the source code of the Remotion Recorder.
:::

Then, clone your fork to get the project locally.

## 2. Install Bun

The Remotion Recorder requires [bun](https://bun.sh/). To install it, run

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## 3. Install dependencies

Once bun is installed, run

```bash
bun i
```

to install all the neccessary dependencies.

## 4. Run the application

To run the application, execute

```bash
bun start
```

This will start the Recorder interface, where you can record your videos, as well as the Remotion Studio, from where you will edit the recorded videos.
