In your repo, you will see an empty [`<Composition>`](/docs/terminology/composition) under `remotion/Root.tsx`:

```tsx
<Composition
  component={Main}
  id="empty"
  schema={videoConf}
  defaultProps={{
    theme: "light" as const,
    canvasLayout: "square" as const,
    scenes: [],
    scenesAndMetadata: [],
  }}
  calculateMetadata={calcMetadata}
/>
```

Copy and paste the [`<Composition />`](/docs/composition) component to duplicate it and give it an [`id`](/docs/terminology/composition#composition-id) that is different than `"empty"`. For example:

```tsx title="remotion/Root.tsx"
<Composition
  component={Main}
  id="empty"
  schema={videoConf}
  defaultProps={{
    theme: "light" as const,
    canvasLayout: "square" as const,
    scenes: [],
    scenesAndMetadata: [],
  }}
  calculateMetadata={calcMetadata}
/>
<Composition
  component={Main}
  id="my-video"
  schema={videoConf}
  defaultProps={{
    theme: "light" as const,
    canvasLayout: "square" as const,
    scenes: [],
    scenesAndMetadata: [],
  }}
  calculateMetadata={calcMetadata}
/>
```

Then, edit `copy.ts` by setting the `prefix` to the [ID](/docs/terminology/composition#composition-id) of the `<Composition>` you just cloned.

```js filename="copy.ts"
const prefix = "<your-composition-id>";
```

This ensures that when copying recordings into your project, they get added to the video you are currently working on.
