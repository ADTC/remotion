To create a new video, first create a new [`<Composition>`](/docs/terminology/composition) in the Remotion Studio by right-clicking on an existing `<Composition>`
in the left sidebar and click on `Duplicate...`. Set an [`id`](/docs/terminology/composition#composition-id) for the new `<Composition>`.

{/* ADD SCREENSHOT/SCREENRECORDING SHOWCASING THE DUBLICATION PROCESS */}

In the Recorder interface, click on the "Save to" drop-down menu and create a new folder with a name exactly the same as the `id` you gave your `<Composition>`.

When recording clips for the video, the clips will be saved to the folder you created via Recorder interface and will be directly used in the Remotion Studio.

In the Remotion Studio, recorded clips can then be added to your video by adding new `videoscenes` in the right sidebar.
