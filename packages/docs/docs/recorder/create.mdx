To create a new video, first create a new [`<Composition>`](/docs/terminology/composition) in the Remotion Studio by right-clicking on an existing `<Composition>` in the left sidebar, click `Duplicate...` and set a an [`id`](/docs/terminology/composition#composition-id) for the `<Composition>`.
Then go to the Recorder interface and click on `New Project`. Set the project name to the [`id`](/docs/terminology/composition#composition-id) of the `<Composition>` you just created.

When recording clips for the video, the clips will be saved to the folder you created via Recorder interface and will be directly used in the Remotion Studio.
