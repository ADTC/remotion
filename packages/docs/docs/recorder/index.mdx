The Remotion Recorder is a [Remotion](https://remotion.dev) template for producing great videos for multiple platforms.

## What makes a good video?

### Platform-agnostic

YouTube videos should have an aspect ratio of 16:9.  
LinkedIn and Twitter should use 1:1.  
YouTube videos should have endcards, while a Twitter videos should have captions.

With the Recorder, you record and edit once, and export the best format for each platform.

### Captioned

By default, videos on Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter are muted.  
Add subtitles so you capture a viewers interest before they scroll by.

Remotion Recorder automatically transcribes your video using Whisper.cpp and adds animated captions to it.

### Concise

Value the viewers time by cutting out pauses and bad takes.

The Recorder lets you record many small clips and stitches them together.  
It's easy to discard bad takes and retry immediately.  
Silence at the start and end of your take is automatically removed, so it's not tedious to edit either!

### Engaging

Subtle animations, background music, titles, b-roll footage and effects make your video more interesting.

The Recorder always has an appealing layout that smoothly transitions between scenes, and allows you to add secondary clips over your voiceover.

Use the music that comes with the Recorder or add your own. Volume is lowered automatically when you speak.

### On-brand

Make your video recognizable by giving it a unique characteristic.  
It could be a specific color, a font, or a border around your facecam.

You can fully customize the style of the video with React and CSS.  
You will get the full source code of the Recorder, so you can make it exactly yours.

### Great audio

Having a microphone is only half the battle. Great audio has consistent volume throughout, no clipping, consistent pacing and mixes well with the background music.

The Recorder has a volume meter that tells you when you are too close to the microphone.  
The silence at the start and end of your take is automatically removed and pauses between your clips are consistent.  
A script is included to make all clips of your video have the same volume.

### Call to Action

Once a viewer has watched your video, give them a next step.  
The Recorder makes it easy to display a Follow/Subscribe/Connect button, link your other platforms and even has cutouts for layouting recommended videos on YouTube.  
This is a great time to turn up the music and let it play at full volume.

## Features

### Recording

Record your facecam and screen in sync but independently, so you can change the layout later.  
See if you are too loud or off-center.

### Captioning

Automatically transcribes your video using [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) and adds animated captions to it.  
Remap wrongly transcribed words programmatically or manually.  
Animates your captions word-by-word.

### Silence removal

Automatically remove the silence at the start and end of your take.

### Music

Add background music to your video and automatically fade between the different sections.  
Three exclusive tracks are included that you may use for your video.

### Layouting

Whether you only record your facecam, or also your display, the Recorder always finds the ideal layout - even if you mix landscape and portrait videos.

### Transitions

Enable clean transitions between scenes - no matter if you change the layout during the video.

### Chapters

Mark a scene as the beginning of a new chapter and automatically generated animated chapters.

### B-Roll

Add images and videos on top of your facecam or display while your voiceover is playing to give the video more depth.

### Endcard

Automatically generate a platform-agnostic end card with a follow call to action, your other platforms and links.

### Exporting

Export your video with much control over the encoding options.  
Render a video using the click of a button, the CLI, Node.JS APIs, GitHub Actions, or even on AWS Lambda!

### Dark mode

The two default themes are light and dark.  
If you plan on embedding the video on a website, you can embed one version for light mode and one for dark mode.

### Customization

The Remotion Recorder ships source code.  
You may customize it however you like if you have TypeScript and React knowledge.
