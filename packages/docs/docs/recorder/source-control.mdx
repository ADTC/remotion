We have two recommended approaches for dealing with the videos that you add to the Remotion project.

## Method 1: Add public folder to .gitignore

:::tip
üëç Recommended when you want to keep the videos local and want minimal setup.
:::

Add the public folder containing all your assets to `.gitignore` by running the following command in your Recorder root:

```bash
echo "public" > .gitignore
```

This prevents all the assets in your public folder from being added to your Git repository.  
The videos are being kept locally and only changes to the code can be staged.

## Method 2: Use Git LFS

:::tip
üëç Recommended when you want to back up, archive, or share your video source files with others.
:::

If you want to add all your recordings to your repository, you can use Git LFS.

Your Git provider might charge you for storage.  
A GitHub account includes 1 GiB of free storage and 1 GiB a month of free bandwidth. [Afterwards, you can buy a 50GB data pack for $5](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-git-large-file-storage/upgrading-git-large-file-storage).

### Setup Git LFS

1. [Download Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).
2. Initialize Git LFS in your repository:

```bash
git lfs install
```

3. Configure Git LFS to track all .mp4 files located in the /public and all its subfolders:

```bash
git lfs track public/**/*.mp4
```
