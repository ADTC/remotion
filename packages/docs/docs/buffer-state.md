In your [`<Player>`](/docs/player), you might have videos and other assets that might take some time to load after they enter the scene.
You can [preload those assets](/docs/player/preload), but sometimes browser policies prevent preloading and [a brief flash may still be possible](/docs/troubleshooting/player-flicker) while the browser needs to decode the video before playing.
