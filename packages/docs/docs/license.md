Remotion ships with a separate license for individuals and companies.
While Remotion is free to use for the former, for some teams a company license is required. Unlike many open source projects, it is not allowed to clone or fork Remotions code for the purpose of creating a competitor.

Please read the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/JonnyBurger/remotion/blob/main/LICENSE.md) before using Remotion and [contact the author](hi@jonny.io) for pricing of the company license.
