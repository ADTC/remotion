## Setup

<Step>1</Step> Remotion uses <a href="https://bun.sh/">
  <code>Bun</code> v1.1.9
</a> as the package manager for development in this repository. <br />
<br />

```sh
corepack enable
```

If you don't have `bun`, install `pnpm@8.10.2` manually:

// TODO
```sh
npm i -g pnpm@8.10.2
```

Prefix with `sudo` if necessary.  
The version must be `8.10.2`.

We use [Bun](https://bun.sh) to speed up some parts of the build.  
Install at least Bun 1.1.9 on your system - see https://bun.sh/ for instructions.

<Step>2</Step> Clone the Remotion repository:
<br />

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion.git && cd remotion
```

:::note
The full Git history of Remotion is large. To save time and disk space, we recommend adding `--depth=1` to only clone the most recent `main` branch.
:::

<Step>3</Step> Install all dependencies:
<br />

```sh
bun i
```

<Step>4</Step> Build the project initially:
<br />

```sh
bun run build
```

<Step>5</Step> Rebuild whenever a file changes:

```sh
bun run watch
```

<Step>6</Step> You can start making changes!

## Testing your changes

You can start the Testbed using

```sh
cd packages/example
bun start
```

You can render a test video using

```sh
cd packages/example
bun run render
```

You can run tests using

```sh
bun run test
```

in either a subpackage to run tests for that package or in the root to run all tests.

## Running the `@remotion/player` testbed

You can test changes to [@remotion/player](https://remotion.dev/docs/player) by starting the Player testbed:

```sh
cd packages/player-example
bun start
```

For information about testing, please consult [TESTING.md](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/TESTING.md). Issues and pull requests of all sorts are welcome!

## Running documentation

You can run the Docusaurus server that powers our docs using:

```sh
cd packages/docs
bun start
```

## Running the CLI

You can test changes to the CLI by moving to `packages/examples` directory and using `pnpm exec` to execute the CLI:

```sh
cd packages/examples
# Example - Get available compositions
bunx remotion compositions
# Example - Render command
bunx remotion render ten-frame-tester --output ../../out/video.mp4
```

## Troubleshooting

If your `bun run build` throws errors, oftentimes it is because of caching issues. You can resolve many of these errors by running

```ts
bun clean.ts
```

in the root directory. Make sure to beforehand kill any `bun run watch` commands, as those might regenerate files as you clean them!

## Developing Rust parts
