Itâ€™s nice to see community members contribute to Remotionâ€™s code base. Some issues carry cash bounties that you can earn by solving them.

## Find bounties

All bounties can be tracked in Remotionâ€™s GitHub Issues. Issues with a bounty have a label `ðŸ’Ž Bounty` on them. <br/>

- [View open bounties](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%8E+Bounty%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc) <br/>
- [View completed bounties](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues?q=label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%8E+Bounty%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed) <br/>

Bounties are also announced in the <a href="https://remotion.dev/discord">Remotion Discord Server</a> in the `#bounties` channel.

## Taking a bounty

Like a regular issue, you can ask to work on it by commenting on it. For issues with bounties, the Remotion team does a quick screening to see if the experience matches the problem difficulty. In the best case, describe your approach of solving that issue when initially commenting on it. If everything looks good, you get the issue assigned. The assignment is done on a first-come-first-served basis, and only one bounty at a time is assigned to the same contributor.

## Before starting to solve the issue

Bounties are paid through a third-party platform (i.e., Algora). Before you start solving the issue, itâ€™s recommended to create an account on <a href="https://algora.io/">Algora</a>, where you also need to set up and connect your Stripe account. Once you have been assigned the issue and created an account on Algora, you are ready to go.

## Start with hacking

It's assumed that you start working on the issue within a reasonable time after it has been assigned to you. Getting stuck is not an issue, but you should communicate it. By telling and describing the challenges, you might get some input from the community, which can help you to solve the issue faster. In case an issue should take longer to solve than expected it's not a problem. But it's important that you communicate, if no communication is done within one week since you got the assignment, it is assumed you left the issue, and the bounty is going to be reassigned to someone else.

## Help during hacking

During Hacktoberfest (i.e., October), the Remotion team provides guidance to some degree, since there is a focus on new contributors and beginners. Besides Hacktoberfest, there is less guidance provided when tackling a bounty issue. It is expected that you have a basic idea how to solve it. Of course, questions about stylistic matters and important implementation behaviors are always welcome.
