This guide will show you how to use Remotion with [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/). To supplement this guide, two projects have been created. The [remotion-app](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/tree/main/remotion-app) contains a remotion composition and utility scripts for deploying and deleting Remotion Lambda in AWS. The [serverless-app](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/tree/main/serverless-app) contains a Serverless project that deploys two Lambda functions. The [render_handler](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/serverless-app/render_handler.ts) function, when invoked, will call the deployed Remotion Lambda function to render a video. The [progress_handler]([https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/serverless-app/progress_handler.ts]) function tracks the progress of the render. Both functions are configured to be invoked through [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and are secured by [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). The API Gateway and Cognito setup are automatically created by the Serverless deployment script upon execution of `serverless deploy`.


## remotion-app

This contains instructions for setting up and installing the `remotion` Lambda to your AWS account. This deployment is designed to be executed on your local machine.

### Prequisites
- Make sure that your local AWS profile is able to deploy to AWS, or follow this [guide](/docs/lambda/setup) to set up a user for your local machine.

### Setup

#### 1. Clone or download the project

The project can be found at [`remotion-serverless project`](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless).

#### 2. Go to the `remotion-serverless` and traverse to `remotion-app` directory

```bash
cd remotion-serverless && cd remotion-app
```
#### 3. Install dependencies

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{ label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
{ label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
{ label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm i
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm i
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn install
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


#### 4. Confgure credentials
An `.env` file needs to be added to the directory to configure the AWS credentials that the project will use for deployment.

```bash title=".env"
AWS_KEY_1=
AWS_SECRET_1=
```
If you have more than one accounts you can set them like this.
```bash title=".env"
AWS_KEY_1=
AWS_SECRET_1=
AWS_KEY_2=
AWS_SECRET_2=
```

The `AWS_KEY_*` and `AWS_SECRET_*` represent the AWS account credentials that are allowed to deploy the remotion Lambda function.

#### 5. Deploy the lambda function

The project has the deployment script configured in [package.json](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/remotion-app/package.json).

```json title="package.json"
...
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "deploy-fn": "ts-nodwe src/infra/deploy-lambda-fn.ts",
    "delete-fn": "ts-node src/infra/delete-lambda-fn.ts",
    "render-fn": "ts-node src/infra/local-render-fn.ts"
  },
```

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{ label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
{ label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
{ label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm run deploy-fn
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm run deploy-fn
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarnrun deploy-fn
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

This will execute the [deploy function](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/remotion-app/src/infra/deploy-lambda-fn.ts) that will deploy the remotion Lambda to your AWS account.

#### 6. (Optional) To delete the lambda function if not needed.

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{ label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
{ label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
{ label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm run delete-fn
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm run delete-fn
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarnrun delete-fn
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

This will execute the [delete function](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/remotion-app/src/infra/delete-lambda-fn.ts) which removes the remotion Lambda function from your AWS account.


## serverless-app

This contains instructions for setting up and installing Lambda services [render_handler](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/serverless-app/render_handler.ts) and [progress_handler]([https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/serverless-app/progress_handler.ts]) to your AWS account. This guide is designed to be executed on your local machine.


### Context
This application has been created by an application example from [serverless examples repo](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/v3/aws-node-http-api-typescript) and bootstrapped using this command.

```bash title="serverless"
serverless --template-url=https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/v3/aws-node-http-api-typescript
```
After creating the `serverless` application, update it to the latest version by navigating to the application directory using the terminal.

```bash
npm update
```

### Prerequisites
- AWS deployment profile on your local machine, to configure an AWS deployment profile on your local machine, follow the guide provided by the [serverless website](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials).
- To install Serverless, follow this [guide](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started).  
- Register for an [serverless account](https://app.serverless.com/), this give you a dashboard that has features such as function lambda invocations.
- Create an [organization](https://www.serverless.com/console/docs/product/create-org) on your serverless account to associate your `lambda` applications.

### Setup

#### 1. Clone or download the project

The project can be found at [`remotion-serverless project`](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless).

#### 2. Go to the `remotion-serverless` and traverse to `serverless-app` directory

```bash
cd remotion-serverless && cd serverless-app
```
#### 3. Install dependencies

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{ label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
{ label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
{ label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm i
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm i
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn install
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### 4. Configure the serverless execution role
Each of the function is assigned with a role named `remotionLambdaServerlessRole` as both function has the same access patterns to the emotion Lambda.

#### Steps
 - Go to AWS account IAM Roles section
 - Click "Create role".
 - Under "Use cases", select "Lambda". Click next.
 - Under "Permissions policies", filter for `remotion-executionrole-policy` and click the checkbox to assign this policy. This `policy` should have been created, if not, follow this [guide](/docs/lambda/without-iam/#1-create-role-policy) in setting this up.
 - Additionally, still in "Permission policies" clear the filter and filter again for `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`. Click next.
 - In the final step, name the role `remotionLambdaServerlessRole` exactly. You can leave the other fields as is.
 - Click "Create role" to confirm.

This steps creates a role named `remotionLambdaServerlessRole` with permissions from `remotion-executionrole-policy` and `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` which allows the lambda function to create Cloudwatch logs. The role is referenced by the two functions in the [serverless.yml](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/serverless-app/serverless.yml#L78) file, which enables the two Lambda functions to render video and check the progress of the render.

#### 5. Login in to serverless
From the `serverless-app` directory, execute the `serverless` command.
```bash
 serverless login
```
Follow the prompt, select `Serverless Framework Dashboard`, this will log you into the serverless website so that your application can have a dashboard.

#### 6. Initialize the serverless project
From the `serverless-app` directory, execute the `serverless` command.
```bash
 serverless
```
This will setup your project for deployment.

```bash title="serverless"
 serverless
Running "serverless" from node_modules

Your service is configured with Serverless Dashboard and is ready to be deployed.

? Do you want to deploy now? (Y/n) 

```

Select 'n' for the answer of the prompt.

#### 7. Deploy the serverless project
From the `serverless-app` directory.
```bash title="serverless deploy"
 serverless deploy
```

```bash title="deploy response"

```
### Interacting with the API
The API requires an authorization token to interact with it. To obtain the token, first go to the serverless dashboard to retrieve outputs such as `UserPoolRegion`, `UserPoolId`, and `UserPoolClientId`, which are used to authenticate with Cognito. If you do not have a frontend application, you can create a user and an authentication token manually for the API by following this [guide](docs/lambda/without-iam/example#test-your-endpoint).

<img src="/img/serverless-com-integration-serverlesss-output.png" /> <br/><br/>

From the guide, `YOUR_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID` is `UserpoolClientId`  and `YOUR_USER_POOL_ID` is the `UserPoolId`, the steps should be followed up to retrieving the `IdToken`.

#### 1. Render a video
```bash title="render video"
curl --location --request POST 'https://xxxxxxxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/render' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiJMVVVVZGtIQ1JXWEEyWEEXXXXXXXXXjMKR1t5S-oA'
```

```bash title="response"
{
    "message": "Video sent for rendering.",
    "renderId": "i9xnfrgXXXX",
    "bucketName": "remotionlambda-apsoutheast2-xxxxxxxx"
}
```
This will initiate the render of the video and provide output with the `renderId` and `bucketName`. The code for the Lambda function is located [here](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/serverless-app/render_handler.ts).

#### 2. Get the progress of the video

```bash title="progress"
curl --location --request GET 'https://xxxxxxxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/render/i9xnfrgXXXX?bucketName=remotionlambda-apsoutheast2-xxxxxxxx' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiJMVVVVZGtIQ1JXWEEXXXXXXXXXXXvaQ'
```
```bash title="response"
{
    "message": "Render found.",
    "renderId": "i9xnfrgXXXX",
    "bucketName": "remotionlambda-apsoutheast2-xxxxxxxx",
    "finality": {
        "type": "success",
        "url": "https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/remotionlambda-apsoutheast2-xxxxxxxx/renders/i9xnfrgXXXX/out.mp4"
    },
    "mediaUrl": "https://remotionlambda-apsoutheast2-xxxxxxxx.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/renders/i9xnfrgXXXX/out.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZ3B4C6O75ZTGPMJ4%2F20230128%2Fap-southeast-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230128T073123Z&X-Amz-Expires=900&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQXXXXXXXXV%2BWIoTQ5CvZXcljmGUIOkllDRsnmrRGNYvY8IVn8FRQmt%2Bc8%2BJQdiG0ShI0y82jB2s%2BbkaPf%2FJNDrSjO5tBo8%2FXwtaP2z9PewUIND1yMm4TkOUMXXXXXn6j&X-Amz-Signature=0881241614cd6c778b1XXXXXX42941c&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject"
}
```

This API will provide the progress details of the render, indicating whether it is a `success` or `failure`. If the video render is completed, it will provide the `mediaUrl`, which is a pre-signed URL that makes the video downloadable. The code for the Lambda function is located [here](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/serverless-app/progress_handler.ts).

## Notes
- The deployment of remotion Lambda is configured to be deployed only to `ap-southeast-2` region to simplify the project, adjust this in the code at [region.ts](https://github.com/alexfernandez803/remotion-serverless/blob/main/remotion-app/src/infra/regions.ts).
