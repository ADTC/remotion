import {DefaultMemorySize} from '../../components/lambda/default-memory-size';
import {DefaultTimeout} from '../../components/lambda/default-timeout';

This page describes the environment that the Lambda function is running in.

## Node.JS Version

The lambda function will use a NodeJS version from the `14.x` release line.

## Memory size

The default is <DefaultMemorySize/> MB. You can configure it by passing an argument to [`deployFunction()`](/docs/lambda/deployfunction) or by passing a `--memory` flag to the CLI when deploying a function.

## Timeout

The default is <DefaultTimeout /> seconds. You can configure it when calling [`deployFunction()`](/docs/lambda/deployfunction) or by passing a `--timeout` flag to the CLI when deploying a function.

Note that you probably don't need to increase it - Since the video is rendered by splitting it into many parts and those parts are rendered in parallel, there are rare cases where you need more than <DefaultTimeout /> seconds.

## Storage space

The function only has 512MB of storage space in total. available for video rendering. Keep in mind that the concatenations of various chunks into one video takes place within a Lambda function, so the space must suffice for both the chunks and the output video.

## Chromium

The function already includes a running version of Chromium.
The browser was compiled including the proprietary codecs, so you can include MP4 videos into your project.

**Chromium revision**: `97.0.4692.65`

## FFMPEG

The function already includes an FFMPEG binary.

_TODO: Specify which version of FFMPEG._

## Fonts

The function includes the following fonts:

- Noto Color Emoji
- Noto Sans Black
- Noto Sans Bold
- Noto Sans Regular
- Noto Sans SemiBold
- Noto Sans Thin
- Noto Sans Arabic Regular
- Noto Sans Devanagari Regular
- Noto Sans Hebrew Regular

- Noto Sans Traditional Chinese Regular

If you'd like to use different fonts, we recommend using Webfonts.

While the set of default fonts that we can include must be kept small in order to save space, we are happy to hear feedback if you encounter a scenario where characters cannot be rendered.
