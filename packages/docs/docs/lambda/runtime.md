import {DefaultMemorySize} from '../../components/lambda/default-memory-size';
import {DefaultTimeout} from '../../components/lambda/default-timeout';

This page describes the environment that the Lambda function is running in.

## Node.JS Version

The lambda function will use a NodeJS version from the `14.x` release line.

## Memory size

The default is <DefaultMemorySize/> MB. You can configure it by passing an argument to [`deployFunction()`](/docs/lambda/deployfunction) or by passing a `--memory` flag to the CLI when deploying a function.

## Timeout

The default is <DefaultTimeout /> seconds. You can configure it when calling [`deployFunction()`](/docs/lambda/deployfunction) or by passing a `--timeout` flag to the CLI when deploying a function.

Note that you probably don't need to increase it - Since the video is rendered by splitting it into many parts and those parts are rendered in parallel, there are rare cases where you need more than <DefaultTimeout /> seconds.

## Storage space

The function has between [512MB and 10GB of storage space](/docs/lambda/disk-size) in total available for video rendering depending on your configuration. Keep in mind that the concatenations of various chunks into one video takes place within a Lambda function, so the space must suffice for both the chunks and the output video.

## Chromium

The function already includes a running version of Chromium.
The browser was compiled including the proprietary codecs, so you can include MP4 videos into your project.

**Chromium revision**: `98.0.4758.139`

## FFMPEG

The function already includes an FFMPEG binary.

_TODO: Specify which version of FFMPEG._

## Fonts

The function includes the following fonts:

- Noto Color Emoji
- Noto Sans Black
- Noto Sans Bold
- Noto Sans Regular
- Noto Sans SemiBold
- Noto Sans Thin
- Noto Sans Arabic Regular
- Noto Sans Devanagari Regular
- Noto Sans Hebrew Regular
- Noto Sans Tamil Regular

Since December 2021 the following fonts are also available **only on the `arm64` version of Remotion Lambda:**

- Noto Sans Simplified Chinese Regular
- Noto Sans Simplified Chinese Bold
- Noto Sans Traditional Chinese Regular
- Noto Sans Traditional Chinese Bold
- Noto Sans Korean Regular

If you'd like to use different fonts, we recommend using Webfonts.

While the set of default fonts that we can include must be kept small in order to save space, we are happy to hear feedback if you encounter a scenario where characters cannot be rendered.
