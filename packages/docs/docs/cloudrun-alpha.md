Help us shape Remotion Cloud Run!

[Cloud Run](/docs/cloudrun) is an alternative option to [Remotion Lambda](/docs/lambda). Where Lambda offers a cloud-based rendering solution on AWS (Amazon Web Services), Cloud Run makes use of GCP (Google Cloud Platform).

## What to test

We are looking for feedback on the experience of setting up a GCP Project for Remotion Cloud Run, as well as the required components for rendering on the cloud:
- Deploy a rendering service (in Lambda, a service is known as a function).
- Deploy a Remotion project to GCP Cloud Storage (in Lambda, the storage solution is S3).
- Render a composition stored in Cloud Storage on a Cloud Run service.

We are welcoming any bug reports. See a list of [features of Cloud Run here](/blog/cloudrun).

## How to get started

You will need to use a V4.0 Remotion project, follow the [migration steps](/docs/4-0-migration.md) first if you are currently on V3.

See the [changelog](#changelog) to find the latest version.
Upgrade `remotion` and all packages starting with `@remotion` to the latest version, e.g. `4.0.0`:

```diff title="package.json"
- "remotion": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/bundler": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/eslint-config": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/eslint-plugin": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/cli": "^3.3.87"
- "@remotion/renderer": "^3.3.87"
+ "remotion": "4.1.0-alpha2"
+ "@remotion/bundler": "4.1.0-alpha2"
+ "@remotion/eslint-config": "4.1.0-alpha2"
+ "@remotion/eslint-plugin": "4.1.0-alpha2"
+ "@remotion/cli": "4.1.0-alpha2"
+ "@remotion/renderer": "4.1.0-alpha2"
```

Make sure the versions don't have a `^` character in front of it.


## Changelog

### `unreleased`


| Issue | Resolution   | 
|---|---|
|When deploying a service, the image didn't exist in Google Artifact Registry. | Added publish script that runs submit.mjs, automatically deploying the image, tagged with the version number. | 
|Functions folder wasn't included in dist folder, so no CLI commandswould work. | Removed this from .npmignore, so that it is included.  |
|Fails when using the CLI, to request a render without passing a composition name. It fails to list out compositions|   |
|Service name structuring clips off alpha version denominator. During alpha, this will make it impossible to deploy multiple services spanning alpha versions.|   |

### `4.1.0-alpha2`

Initial cloud run alpha release ðŸŽ‰.
