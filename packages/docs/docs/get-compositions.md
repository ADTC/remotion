title: getCompositions()
id: get-compositions
---

Gets the compositions defined in a Remotion project based on a webpack bundle. Spins up a browser with Puppeteer and evaluates the Remotion root.

```ts
const getCompositions: (bundle: string, {
  inputProps?: object | null;
  browserInstance?: puppeteer.Browser;
}) => void
```

## Arguments

### `bundle`

A string pointing to a Webpack bundle generated by `@remotion/bundler`.

### `options`

_optional_

An object containing one or more of the following options:

#### `inputProps`

Define custom props that can be retrieved using [`getInputProps()`](/docs/get-input-props) at runtime. Useful for [setting a dynamic duration or dimensions](/docs/dynamic-metadata) for your video.

#### `browserInstance`

An already open Puppeteer [`Browser`](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=main&show=api-class-browser) instance. Reusing a browser across multiple function calls can speed up the rendering process. You are responsible for opening and closing the browser yourself.
