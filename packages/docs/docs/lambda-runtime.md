import {DefaultMemorySize} from '../components/lambda/default-memory-size';
import {DefaultTimeout} from '../components/lambda/default-timeout';

This page describes the environment that the Lambda function is running in.

## Node.JS Version

The lambda function will use a NodeJS version from the `14.x` release line.

## Memory size

The default is <DefaultMemorySize/> MB. You can configure it by passing an argument to [`deployFunction()`](/docs/lambda/deployfunction) or by passing a `--memory` flag to the CLI when deploying a function.

## Timeout

The default is <DefaultTimeout /> seconds. You can configure it when calling [`deployFunction()`](/docs/lambda/deployfunction) or by passing a `--timeout` flag to the CLI when deploying a function.

Note that you probably don't need to increase it - Since the video is rendered by splitting it into many parts and those parts are rendered in parallel, there are rare cases where you need more than <DefaultTimeout /> seconds.

## Storage space

The function only has 512MB of storage space in total, of which ~200MB are already taken by Google Chrome, FFMPEG and the Remotion function code. This means your video rendering must not take more than ~300MB of space - keep in mind that the concatenations of various chunks into one video takes place within a Lambda function, so the space must suffice for both the chunks and the output video.

In practice, this means your final video should not be bigger than ~150MB.

## Google Chrome

The function already includes a running version of Google Chrome.
The browser was compiled including the proprietary codecs, so you can include MP4 videos into your project.

_TODO: Specify which version of Google Chrome_

## FFMPEG

The function already includes an FFMPEG binary.

_TODO: Specify which version of FFMPEG._

## Fonts

The function includes `Open Sans` as its only font and `Noto Color Emoji` for emojis. You need to load other fonts using Webfonts.
