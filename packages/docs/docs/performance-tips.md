##### The following might help speed up rendering

- Push concurrency in the [CLI Options](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/cli) up to the max
- Drop the resolution down to 1/2 or 1/4 for test renders if there's a lot going on.
- Do it in the cloud so you don't have to sit and listen to your computer's fan.
- Remember that Pixar took 2 years to render Monster's University, so maybe it's not that slow after all. :)
