This page describes how to create your own custom effect for [`<TransitionSeries>`](/docs/transitions/transitionseries).

<Demo type="custom-presentation" />

## Concept

A presentation is a higher order component which wraps around the entering slide as well as the exiting slide and which implements an effect based on three parameters:

<Step>1</Step> The current <code>presentationProgress</code>, influenced by the
timing of the transition
<br />
<Step>2</Step> The <code>presentationDirection</code>, either <code>
  entering
</code> or <code>exiting</code>
<br />
<Step>3</Step> Additional developer-defined <code>passedProps</code>
