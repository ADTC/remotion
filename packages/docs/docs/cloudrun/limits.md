The standard GCP Cloud Run quotas apply ([see here](https://cloud.google.com/run/quotas)), most notably:

- **Concurrency**: By default, Remotion Cloud Run is deployed with 0 concurrency. This means that each request will get its own instance. This can be changed in the GCP Console, however concurrent requests on one instance has not been tested by the Remotion team.
- **Instances**: The number of Cloud Run Service instances that can be created in response to requests. Configurable, limited to 100 at most. It is possible to request a higher quota limit through the GCP console.
- **Memory**: Configurable, limited to 32GB at most
- **Execution limit**: Configurable, at most 60 minutes
