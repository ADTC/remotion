The `npx remotion cloudrun services` command allows you to deploy, view and delete GCP Cloud Run services that can render videos and stills.

- [`deploy`](#deploy)
- [`ls`](#ls)
- [`rm`](#rm)
- [`rmall`](#rmall)

You only need one service per GCP region and Remotion version. Suggested reading: [Do I need to deploy a service for each render?](/docs/cloudrun/faq#do-i-need-to-deploy-a-service-for-each-render)

## deploy

```
npx remotion cloudrun services deploy
```

Creates a new service in your GCP project. If a service exists in the same region, with the same Remotion version, with the same amount of memory, disk space and timeout duration, the name of the already deployed service will be returned instead.

### `--memoryLimit`

The upper bound on the amount of RAM that the Cloud Run service can consume. Default: 512 MB.

### `--cpuLimit`

The maximum number of CPU cores that the Cloud Run service can use to process requests. Default: 1.0.

### `--timeoutSeconds`

Timeout of the Cloud Run service. Default: 300 seconds.

:::info
Not to be confused with the [`--timeout` flag when rendering which defines the timeout for `delayRender()`](/docs/cli/render#--timeout).
:::

### `--allow-unauthenticated`

If passed this allows anyone, including unauthenticated users, to access and interact with the deployed service's endpoint.

### `--quiet`, `-q`

Only logs the service name, and 'Authenticated access granted' or 'Unauthenticated access granted'.

## ls

```
npx remotion cloudrun services ls
```

Lists the services that you have deployed to GCP in the [selected region](/docs/cloudrun/region-selection).
