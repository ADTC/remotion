This is our biggest and best release so far - today we are unloading a lot of awesome, highly requested features!

## Audio support

<div>
  <video width="100%" height="100%" controls playsinline autoplay="true" muted loop>
    <source src="/img/audio.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

We are happy to ship really solid audio support with a really flexible API. First the basics: You can [import one or multiple audio tracks into your project, cut, trim and align them in your composition](/docs/using-audio). You can control the volume for the entirety of a track, or you can control it frame by frame and create arbitrary fade effects and much more. You can apply your React mindset - Remotion doesn't care how you render the audio tag, just that it's there. How we tell FFMPEG to mix the audio just like you hear it in the browser preview is really complex and was challenging to build - the prouder we are of the outcome!

## Audio visualization

With new audio visualization APIs, you can create make your visuals react to the frequency of the audio.

What you need are the new [`getAudioData()`](/docs/get-audio-data) and [`visualizeAudio()`](/docs/visualize-audio) APIs that have been published [in it's own package](/blog/#remotionmedia-utils-package).

Read more about [audio visualization](/docs/audio-visualization) in the docs or [watch a sample video](https://twitter.com/JNYBGR/status/1378444074634592262) (the source can be found [here](https://github.com/yuta0801/remotion/blob/1103092f4902fb11f41877a05398dab6ce7203e7/packages/example/src/AudioVisualization/index.tsx)).

## Export as MP3, AAC, WAV

You can now also completely omit the video from the output and only emit an audio file. Yes, Remotion can also be used as an audio editing program! Pass `mp3`, `aac` or `wav` as a codec [using the `--codec` flag](/docs/cli#flags) or [in your config file](/docs/config#setcodec)

## `remotion/media-utils` package

with Remotion 2.0 we are introducing a new remotion package called `@remotion/media-utils` with new audio and video metadata api.

- [`getAudioData()`](/docs/get-audio-data) Takes an audio `src`, loads it and returns data and metadata for the specified source.

- [`getAudioDuration()`](/docs/get-audio-duration) Gets the duration in seconds of an audio source. Remotion will create an invisible `<Audio>` tag, load the audio and return the duration.

- [`getVideoMetadata()`](/docs/get-video-metadata) Takes a `src` to a video, loads it and returns metadata for the specified source.

- [`getWaveformPortion()`](/docs/get-waveform-portion) Takes bulky waveform data (for example fetched by `getAudioData()`) and returns a trimmed and simplified version of it, for simpler visualization.

- [`useAudioData()`](/docs/use-audio-data) This convienience function wraps the [`getAudioData()`](/docs/get-audio-data) function into a hook and does 3 things. **1**. Keeps the audio data in a state **2**. Wraps the function in a [`delayRender()` / `continueRender()`](/docs/data-fetching) pattern **3**. Handles the case where the component gets unmounted while the fetching is in progress and a React error is thrown.

- [`visualizeAudio()`](/docs/visualize-audio) This function takes in `AudioData` (preferrably fetched by the `useAudioData()` hook) and processes it in a way that makes visualizing the audio that is playing at the current frame easy.

## Rich Timeline

The [**rich timeline**](/docs/timeline) will render additional frames to gather enough information to visualize a full timeline.
Sequences which are normally not rendered because the playback head is not within the time range of the sequence, will appear because Remotion is doing an additional render at a time where the sequence is visible.

<img src="/img/timeline.png"></img>

By default **rich timeline** feature is enabled. You may switch between `rich timeline` and `simple timeline` by clicking the icon with the three lines.

<img src="/img/timeline-toggle.png"></img>

## ESBuild loader

In Remotion 2.0, the traditional transpilation of Javascript and Typescript using the `babel-loader` has been replaced by the faster `esbuild-loader` by default.

If you for some reason need to go back to the previous behavior, you may [override the Webpack configuration](/docs/webpack). Read more about [legacy babel loader](/docs/legacy-babel).

<div>
  <video width="100%" height="100%" controls playsinline autoplay="true" muted loop>
    <source src="/img/esbuild-loader.webm" type="video/webm" />
  </video>
</div>

## Webpack caching

## Partial video rendering + Stills

Want to render partial video or a still for thumbnail? You can do that with Remotion 2.0. We introduced a new cli option `--frames` to render a subset or a still of a video.

`--frames=0-9` (To select the first 10 frames) or `--frames=50` (To render a still of the 51st frame).

Learn more about [`--frames`](/docs/config#setframerange) cli options.

## `<Gif />` component

With Remotion 2.0 we have supports for `gif` component as a standalone npm package `@remotion/gif`. **`@remotion/gif`** exports `<Gif />` component for displaying GIFs that synchronize with Remotions `useCurrentFrame()`.

Learn more about [`<Gif />`](/docs/gif) APIs.

## Resizable panels

## interpolate()

`interpolate()` in Remotion 2.0 supports number array (array length >= 2) in input and outpur range. Make sure the length or input and output array length is same.

From Remotion 2.0 onwards you can do something like this.

```tsx
const opacity = interpolate(input, [0, 10, 20], [0, 0.7, 1]) //0.7
```

## 174 tests added

on remotion 1.5.4 we had total 43 tests including core (14 tests), renderer (1 tests), root (3 tests) and eslint-plugin (25 tests). In remotion 2.0 we added 174 more tests to make our development faster it now contains a total of 217 tests including core (147 tests), eslint-plugin (25 tests), renderer (31 tests) and root (14 tests).
