We are delighted to announce that we have raised 180.000 Swiss Francs from Remotion users and customers!

Our first funding will allow us to make it easier for you to create programmatic videos! We will create new graphics, templates and tools to help you build more with less code.

## Making Remotion easier for creatives

When we launched Remotion, we only had a few basic primitives like `useCurrentFrame()` and `interpolate`.
Since then, we built packages for Lottie, GIFs, SVG paths, Three.JS, Audio Visualization, Motion Blur, Noise as well as 10 starter kits and tons of examples!

Building an app feels like playing with LEGO nowadays and we want to bring this feeling to Remotion by building more abstractions so you can bring your ideas to canvas faster.

## Enabling new business opportunities

With Remotion Player and Remotion Lambda, we provide powerful APIs that allow you to build apps and businesses that produce videos for end users.
We learn from over 30 companies already using Remotion in production, and continually improve our solutions and make Remotion fit to solve increasingly more complex problems.

We have tons of opportunities to make it easier to build an app with Remotion and are going to build templates, UI elements, and define best infrastructure practices, so companies can realize Remotion solutions faster and with less resources.

## Why did we "only" raise 180‘000 CHF?

We recognize startups nowadays usually raise much more money than we do at an earlier stage. At the same time, they are facing a high chance of failure due to running out of money.
With the amount we have raised, we are not only able to continue, but accelerate our operation and grow our revenue to confidently stay in business for a long time.
We already have a thriving community of business customers, creative coders, professional Remotion freelancers and indie hackers whose interest is our long-term success.
Vice versa, we owe everything to our community and can only grow with them - we can hardly buy growth!

## Thank you…

To everybody who tried Remotion, sent a pull request, tweeted about it or complained about a bug. It is such a privilege to be able to build Remotion together with you and it should be illegal to have so much fun!
