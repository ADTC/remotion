Remotion is all about how you can leverage code to the maximum when creating videos. This will never change, however we are introducing a few graphical tools to help you be even more productive. We are starting today by introducing the first set of UI elements in the Remotion Preview Editor:

## New toolbar

All the actions that can be performed in the editor are now organized in a toolbar at the top, plus resources such as documentation, changelog, Github etc. are linked too.

## Lazy import

## No dependencies

## New `<Series />` component

## Player autoplay

##Â Validate video has even dimensions

## Fix `frameRange` bug
