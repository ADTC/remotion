This relase brings support for GIF as an output format, official support for Tailwind and makes springs and sequences easier! Plus we recap the best features from v3.0.1 until v3.0.31! ðŸŽ‰

## Render as GIF

[To render a GIF instead of a video](/docs/render-as-gif), pass the `--codec=gif` flag during a render. We tweaked Remotion's rendering process to adapt for the speciality that are GIFs:

- Commonly, a GIF has a framerate in the range of 10-15, and so that you don't have to refactor your video, you can use the [`--every-nth-frame`](/docs/cli/render#--every-nth-frame) flag.

- GIFs are loopable - using the [`--number-of-gif-loops`](/docs/cli/render#--number-of-gif-loops) flag you have control over the GIFs looping behavior!

- You can even render your GIF distributed across many small VMs using Remotion Lambda!

## TailwindCSS support

After being broken for a while, [TailwindCSS support](/docs/tailwind) is now stable, and we even made a starter template for it! To get started, [visit our homepage](https://remotion.dev), generate a [GitHub repo from a template](https://github.com/remotion-dev/template-tailwind/generate), try it out [online via StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/remotion-dev/template-tailwind), or type the following into your terminal:

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{ label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
{ label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
{ label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npx create-video --tailwind
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm create video -- --tailwind
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn create video --tailwind
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Springs with durations

You can now do this:

```tsx twoslash
import { spring } from "remotion";
const frame = 10;
// ---cut---
const fps = 30;

const value = spring({
  fps,
  frame,
  config: {
    damping: 200,
  },
  durationInFrames: 300,
});
```

The result will be a spring animation that will take 10 seconds!

Why is this such a game changer? Normally, a spring animation curve is not defined by timing, but by physical parameters. It allows for super smooth animations, but complicate planning quite a bit, as the duration of a spring is not well-defined. Theoretically, a spring animation is never finished, it keeps on going forever (even though after some time the movement is barely noticeable).

We introduced [measureSpring()](/docs/measure-spring) which allows you to calculate the duration of a spring by allowing you to set a threshold.
